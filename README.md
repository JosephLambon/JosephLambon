### Hi!

I am a Physics graduate and Implementation Engineer for Ecclesiasical Insurance.

My interest in software engineering was first sparked on my placement year at Cummins during university, where I was able to utilise the programming skills I acquired in my first year studies to develop practical applications. At Cummins, I was able to utilise Microsoft's VBA to automate a laborous spend-comparison process. This being a success, I presented the tool to the Executive Director in the USA. Later, using Python, I was able to analyse complex simulation data to determine the most prominent cause of failure in turbocharger cores.

Following this, I invested time completing Harvard's CS50 course, giving me an understanding of Computer Science fundamentals and introducing me to C, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, advancing my profiency in Python, and even touching on Cybersecurity.

Opting for the 'Scientific Computing' module in final year taught me lessons in optimising code for better run-times, and my final year project on galaxy reddening introduced me to Linux.

After finishing university, I completed Harvard's CS50W course alongside a full-time job as part of a ski season in Whistler, Canada, teaching me to develop web applications using Python and JavaScript. Using frameworks such as Django, React, Bootstrap, SQL, and Selenium, I was able to develop functional applications such as a Social Networking site, a Commerce platform, and a Productivity app.

Feel free to take a look at some of my projects, otherwise, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-lambon/)!
